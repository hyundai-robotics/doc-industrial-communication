# 2. Mounting and Setting the Industrial Communication Card

A PCI communication card (Hilscher) is required to use industrial communication. The method of connecting the communication card in a way that matches the required communication is shown below.

1. Mount the purchased PCI communication card into the Hi6Com (Collaborative robots: Hi6Com Mini).
2. Turn the rotary switch of the PCI communication card to set it to a number ranging from 1 to 4.(Individual numbers should be set if multiple PCI communication cards are to be used.)
